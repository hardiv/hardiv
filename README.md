## 👋 Hi, I'm Hardiv

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I love coding, robotics and AI. �

My mother tongue is Python 🐍, although I also speak Java ☕, C++ and HTML.

I'm also a maker, tinkering with Raspberry Pi and breadboards in my spare time, mostly for robotics projects. ⚡

Feel free to take a look at my pinned repositories below 🙂 (Some of them are a work in progress):
